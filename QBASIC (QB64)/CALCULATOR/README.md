A Basic Calculator Program to perform few basic mathematical operations.

Made this while I was in class 7th, i remember the day when i started making it  
it was the day on which there was waterpark trip in my school but i was at home.
On that somehow i was thinking that i mostly can do a lot of basic mathematical operations in Basic
But what if i had to make a good looking `console cli basic calculator`(by the way at time i did'nt even knew
these kind of fancy words like console and cli, but at time i only made of what i had some knowledge of), i tried
to make it as coulourful as possible and Even used few basic sound effects.

In this i have used very verbose type of management of the entire codebase. Like i have used `GOTO` statements
everywhere instead of a functional approach which makes the code very hard to have a quick overlook of the code
which we can usually do in a functional program.

But this is the thing that at one time i also did such things, it has been a long time scince that,
but this also has been a interesting juorney from that date to now(because i had learned a lot of things on my own
interest and by myself).
Interesting memories...


After that i learned C by borrowing a class 8th student who lived in the same colony. I read the book
and i tried replicating few of my deeds in C also was quite successful as wel.
Then in class 8th we moved from Lucknow to Prayagraj, where i learned java in school(which i already knew Basic
things about, like those which are common in C and Java). Then on my own i learned python. I even went
to the extent of making a gui application in it(Trigonometric Evaluator). After that i was searching for few ways
in which we could our code in mobile also easily, i found that web technology was a good place place to start with.
This is the first time i felt so empowered that i can make few basic good looking real UI apps. This is becuase
as a non technical user who uses websites and mobile or computer applications, he thinks of proramming as 
process of making those interactive UI based applications and the monotonous cli applications.

Then i again in class 10th somehow stumbled on the idea of making a good typing tool for Sanskrit. As it was very
hard typing with the basic guess based typing tools. I initially made it in javascript and then in python to type
in computer. I obviously reiterated on it many times to keep improving and more importantly kepp improving it.
This has been the way of my learning where i learn by making a program/app and the traditional way in which
we learn things theoretically and then implement it. And it does it pros and cons with it. But one good thing
which it does is that it makes the learning process bear much friction in learning journey. Because at that time
we were not learning some verbose boring topic which we are not interwsted but in but rather learnig something
useful which we will apply to make something real.

Now lets also list some fallbacks in this journey, being who i am i alos lost my track of academics not necessaraly
because i was not able to balance this with my aacademics. Actually till class 9th it was going very well. But in class 10th
it was the year when schools were closed due to corona lockdown, this ruined me academically and it seems i am still not able to
recover from it completely. This basically ruined my 11th and 12th performance.
And let us work more conscuously to imporove ourselves.........
