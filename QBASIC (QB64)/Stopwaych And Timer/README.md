A Simple Stopwatch program written in QBASIC(a version of BASIC) compile using QB64.
Made While I was in class 7<sup>th</sup>.

It uses the sound function to sleep for 1 second and in this way tries to simulate a
simple working stopwatch.
Although at few places it is not well wrtten like, there is a pause after the press start after pausing there
stopwatch/timer.

This is from where I started, I had then recently BASIC(which was very basic) in school but that caught my interest.
And had this idea to implement a stopwatch. I searched online to learn about how could this done.
Before coming to know about the `SLEEP/SOUND` function available in BASIC I _foolishly_ tried to evalute 1 second
to the number of iteration(while/for loop) which it can do in 1 second(this was obviously a very bad approach,
not only in terms of accuracy but also in terms of memory and cpu usage).
